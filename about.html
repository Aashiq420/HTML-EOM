      <h1>About Us:</h1>
      <pre>
        We are a non-profit organization determined to find an affordable way 
        for students to excel at mathematics. Our goal right now is to provide 
        free helpful information to grade 10, 11, and 12 students. 
      </pre>
      <h2>Why and how:</h2>
      <pre>
        We were established in 2020 as a group of math tutors wanting to do more to help 
        those who cannot afford the assistance they require. We saw an opportunity to do 
        some good in the world and decided to create this website which we hope to grow 
        larger as we progress. By working together we were able to learn HTML and CSS from 
        one another and we are still learning to this day!</pre
      >
      <h2>Our Goals:</h2>
      <pre>
        Our main goal is very clear: we want to help students get over their fears of 
        mathematics and see the beauty it possesses. We also hope to attract like-minded 
        people who would like to contribute to our cause so that we may grow as quickly 
        as possible.</pre
