        <u><i>Grade 11 Breakdown:</i></u>
      </h1>
      <h2>>Functions</h2>
      <pre>
        ◘ Extend Grade 10 work on the relationships between variables in terms of numerical, graphical, verbal and symbolic representations of functions and convert flexibly 
          between these representations (tables, graphs, words and formulae). Include linear and quadratic polynomial functions, exponential functions, some rational functions 
          and trigonometric functions.

        ◘ Generate as many graphs as necessary, initially by means of point-by-point plotting, supported by available technology, to make and test conjectures and hence generalise 
          the effects of the parameter which results in a horizontal shift and that which results in a horizontal stretch and/or reflection about the y-axis

        ◘ Problem solving and graph work involving the prescribed functions. Average gradient between two points
    </pre
      >
      <h2>>Number Patterns, Sequences and Series</h2>
      <pre>
        ◘ Investigate number patterns leading to those where there is a constant second difference between consecutive terms, and the general term is therefore quadratic
      </pre>
      <h2>>Finance, Growth and Decay</h2>
      <pre>
        ◘ Use simple and compound decay formulae A = P(1 + in) and A = P(1- i)n to solve problems (including straight line depreciation and depreciation on a reducing balance)

        ◘ The effect of different periods of compounding growth and decay (including effective and nominal interest rates)
      </pre>
      <h2>>Algebra</h2>
      <pre>
        ◘ Take note that there exist numbers other than those on the real number line, the so-called nonreal numbers. It is possible to square certain nonreal numbers and obtain 
          negative real numbers as answers

        ◘ Nature of roots

        ◘ Apply the laws of exponents to expressions involving rational exponents

        ◘ Add, subtract, multiply and divide simple surds

        ◘ Revise factorisation

        ◘ Solve:
          (1) Quadratic equations
          (2) Quadratic inequalities in one variable and interpret the solution graphically
          (3) Equations with two unknowns, one of which is linear and the other quadratic
      </pre>
      <h2>>Probability</h2>
      <pre>
          ◘ Dependent and independent events

          ◘ Venn diagrams or contingency tables and tree diagrams as aids to solving probability problems (where events are not necessarily independent)
      </pre>
      <h2>Euclidean Geometry and Measurement</h2>
      <pre>
          ◘ Investigate and prove theorems of the geometry of circles assuming results from earlier grades, together with one other result concerning tangents and radii of circles

          ◘ Solve circle geometry problems, providing reasons for statements when required
      </pre>
      <h2>>Trigonometry</h2>
      <pre>
          ◘ Derive and use the identities: tan θ = sin θ/cos θ and sin² θ + sin² θ = 1

          ◘ Derive the reduction formulae

          ◘ Determine the general solution and / or specific solutions of trigonometric equations

          ◘ Establish the sine, cosine and area rules

          ◘ Solve problems in 2-dimensions
      </pre>
      <h2>>Analytical Geometry</h2>
      <pre>
          ◘ Use a Cartesian co-ordinate system to derive and apply:
            (1) The equation of a line through two given points
            (2) The equation of a line through one point and parallel or perpendicular to a given line
            (3) The inclination of a line
      </pre>
      <h2>>Statistics</h2>
      <pre>
          ◘ Represent Skewed data in box and whisker diagrams, and frequency polygons. Identify outliers

          ◘ Represent measures of central tendency and dispersion in univariate numerical data by:
            (1) Using ogives
            (2) Calculating the variance and standard deviation of sets of data manually (for small sets of data) and using calculators (for larger sets of data) 
                and representing results graphically
